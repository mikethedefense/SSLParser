# Description
This app provides ease of accessibility to interact with a SuperScript Language (SSL), by converting block code into an actionable script. 
Certain functions like "Prompt" were pre-defined by the developer in the SSL codebase.
This application was used by engineers for running simulation test scripts on a DV SITS (Design & Validation System Integration Test Station) rig  (Design and Validation System). 
The goal of this project was to begin the development of an automatic testing environment.
